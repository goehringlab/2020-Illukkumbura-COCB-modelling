## Illukkumbura et al., 2020

Code used to perform PDE modelling in the following paper: 

Illukkumbura, R., Bland, T., and Goehring, N.W. (2020). [Patterning and polarization of cells by intracellular flows.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955067419300924?via=ihub) 
Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 62, 123â€“134.

Model.py contains the model. Figures in the paper (3 and 4d) can be recreated by running scripts in the Figures folder 
(Run.py to the simulations, Figs.py to create the figures).
Tested with Python 3.7
