## Patterning and polarization of cells by intracellular flows (modelling)

Code used to perform PDE modelling in the following paper: 

Illukkumbura, R., Bland, T., and Goehring, N.W. (2020). [Patterning and polarization of cells by intracellular flows.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955067419300924?via=ihub) 
Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 62, 123â€“134.

Model.py contains the model. Figures in the paper (3 and 4d) can be recreated by running scripts in the Figures folder 
(Run.py to run the simulations, Figs.py to create the figures).
Tested with Python 3.7
