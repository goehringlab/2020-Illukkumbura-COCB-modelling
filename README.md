## Illukkumbura et al., 2020

Code used to perform PDE modelling in the following paper: 

Illukkumbura, R., Bland, T., and Goehring, N.W. (2020). Patterning and polarization of cells by intracellular flows. 
Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 62, 123â€“134.

Model.py contains the model. Figures in the paper (3 and 4d) can be recreated by running scripts in the Figures folder 
(Run.py to the simulations, Figs.py to create the figures).
